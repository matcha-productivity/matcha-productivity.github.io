        <h2>Matcha Documentation</h2>
        <p>This is the early development of Matcha, a productivity app that is a hybrid of a to-do list and calendar. I created this because I wanted an app which will allow me to both plan my life in the long term and also efficiently organize my everyday tasks. I wasn't able to find anything online, so I created one.</p>
        <p>The design of Matcha is focused on efficiency and minimalism. The goal is to make this app fase, easy to use, but also packed with features.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to provide suggestions or feedback <a href='https://forms.gle/iggRttZFXmPBvL3cA'>through this form</a>.</p>

        <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pressing SHIFT + ENTER creates a new task for the date you are editing</li>
            <li>Typing /r makes the task red, but color is not saved. Experimental, hoping to integrate in future updates</li>
            <li>Tasks can be deleted when you press DELETE or BACKSPACE in an empty task </li>
            <li>You can check your archived and past tasks by accessing ARCHIVES (automatic)</li>
            <li>Regularly backup your data in case you want to transfer, print, or have a file-version for the future</li>
        </ul>
